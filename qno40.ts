// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
//  The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should
//  return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to
//  make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to
//  show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional
//  parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the 
// albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks
//  on an album.
