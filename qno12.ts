// Q12 - Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Namee:string[] = ["romaisa", "mahrukh", "aatika","maida"];
for (let i = 0 ; i <Namee.length ; i++ ){
    console.log(`Hello ${[Namee[i]]}, pleased to have you here.` )
}
